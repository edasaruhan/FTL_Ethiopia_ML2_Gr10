# Project Title: Intelligent Waste Sorting System

The project aims to create an AI-driven waste segregation system that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify waste materials (plastic, paper, glass, metal, cardboard, trash). The goal is to automate the sorting process in smart bins, improving recycling efficiency and reducing contamination in waste streams.

This project aligns with SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production. By enhancing waste segregation and recycling processes, it contributes to sustainable waste management practices and minimizes environmental impact, promoting a circular economy.

## Literature Examples
- **"Deep Learning for Waste Classification"** - This study explores CNNs for identifying waste materials through image recognition, demonstrating the effectiveness of AI in improving recycling processes.
- **"Smart Waste Management Systems"** - This research discusses IoT-enabled waste management solutions that automate waste collection and segregation, highlighting technological advancements for urban sustainability.

## Data
- **Data Source**: Public datasets of labeled waste images from platforms like Kaggle.
- **Data Format**: Image files (JPEG/PNG) along with CSV files containing labels and categories.
- **Size**: Approximately 10,000 images to ensure comprehensive model training.
- **Preprocessing Steps**: Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to enhance model performance.

## Chosen Approach: Deep Learning (DL)
**Justification**: Given the complexity of image data and the high accuracy required for classification, deep learning techniques such as CNNs are ideal for effectively classifying waste materials, leveraging their strengths in processing visual information.
